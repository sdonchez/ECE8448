	abstract = {Cybersecurity of embedded systems has become a major challenge for the development of the Internet of Things, of Cloud computing and other trendy applications without devoting a signiﬁcant part of the design budget to industrial players. Technologies like TrustZone, provided by ARM, support a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) software architecture and are inexpensive integrated solutions. While this technology allows isolation and secure execution of critical software applications (e.g., banking), recent preliminary works highlighted some security breaches or limitations when the ARM processors are embedded in a FPGA-based heterogeneous SoCs such as the Xilinx Zynq or Intel SoC FPGA devices. This paper highlights the security issue of such complex SoCs and details six efﬁcient attacks on the ARM TrustZone extension in the SoC. A prototype system design on a Xilinx Zynq SoC is the target of the attacks presented in this paper but they could be adapted to other SoCs. This paper also includes recommendations and security solutions to design a trustworthy embedded system with a FPGA-based heterogeneous SoC.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a novel methodology FPGA Trust Zone (FTZ) to incorporate security into the design cycle to detect and isolate anomalies such as Hardware Trojans in the FPGA fabric. Anomalies are identiﬁed using violation to spatial correlation of process variation in FPGA fabric. Anomalies are isolated using Xilinx Isolation Design Flow (IDF) methodology. FTZ helps identify and partition the FPGA into areas that are devoid of anomalies and thus, assists to run designs securely and reliably even in an anomaly-infected FPGA. FTZ also assists IDF to select trustworthy areas for implementing isolated designs and trusted routes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FTZ for AES and RC5 designs on Xilinx Virtex-7 and Atrix-7 FPGAs.},

	abstract = {Up to few years ago, FPGAs were not suitable to develop smart sensor systems because of power consumption and programming effort. Modern technologies and programming techniques overcame these limitations. Furthermore thanks to ﬂexible and efﬁcient reconﬁguration, FPGAs can be used as conﬁgurable wireless sensor nodes and they are very promising in the protection of critical infrastructures. In the recent years, particular emphasis was given to pervasive wireless sensor nodes that enabled the widespread of innovative applications for smartgrid monitoring and mobile cyber-physical infrastructures; although security remains one of the main open challenges to face. In this paper we will analyze all potentialities of adopting FPGAs in protecting Cyber Physical Infrastructures by illustrating with simple scenarios how they can be used to improve security and robustness of heterogeneous networks.},

Currently a number of System-on-Chip platforms exist, which include support for ARM TrustZone. Unfortunately relatively little work has been done on open-source software for TrustZone systems. In our belief this is partly caused by the lack of cost-efﬁcient development boards, which allow access to ARM TrustZone features. This paper discusses experiences made by the authors with a rather inexpensive development board and shows how system-level development on TrustZone-enabled hardware is possible in class-room settings.},

	abstract = {We present the design, implementation and evaluation of the root of trust for the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) provided by ARM TrustZone based on the on-chip SRAM Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs). We ﬁrst implement a building block which provides the foundations for the root of trust: secure key storage and truly random source. The building block doesn’t require on or oﬀ-chip secure non-volatile memory to store secrets, but provides a high-level security: resistance to physical attackers capable of controlling all external interfaces of the system on chip (SoC). Based on the building block, we build the root of trust consisting of seal/unseal primitives for secure services running in the TEE, and a software-only TPM service running in the TEE which provides rich TPM functionalities for the rich OS running in the normal world of TrustZone. The root of trust resists software attackers capable of compromising the entire rich OS. Besides, both the building block and the root of trust run on the powerful ARM processor. In one word, we leverage the on-chip SRAM, commonly available on mobile devices, to achieve a low-cost, secure, and eﬃcient design of the root of trust.},

	abstract = {As the complexity of System-on-Chip (SoC) and the reuse of third party IP continues to grow, the security of a heterogeneous SoC has become a critical issue. In order to increase the software security of such SoC, the TrustZone technology has been proposed by ARM to enforce software security. Nevertheless, many SoC embed non-trusted third party Intellectual Property (IP) trying to take the beneﬁts of this technology. In such case, is the security guaranteed by the ARM TrustZone technology reduced by the heterogeneity of SoC? In order to answer to this question, this paper presents relevant attack scenarios based on third party IP to exploit some security failures of the TrustZone extension through the all SoC. At the end, this article proposes to SoC designers to consider some design solutions to limit the impact of a malicious IP.},
